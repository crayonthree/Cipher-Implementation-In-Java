Matrix Transposition Cipher:

- Matrix Transposition Cipher is an extension of the railfence cipher.

- Instead of having just 2 rows, we have multiple rows, and we do not choose columns one after another
and instead we choose specific columns based on the key. For instance instead of 1,2,3,4,5 we can select
3 4 1 5 2.

- The encryption and decryption are as below:

    |   Encryption
    
    |   Decryption
